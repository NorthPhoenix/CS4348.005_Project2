CS 4348.005 Project 2 Part 1 Report
Members:
Haniya Zafar
Nikita Istomin
Zubair Shaik

Contributions: 
Zubair: worked on the add_free_block(), and get_free_block(), and main() functions.
Nikita: worked on add_free_block() and initfs() functions + debugging.
Haniya: worked on add_free_block() and initfs() functions. 

Haniya's Lessons Learned: 
-Using lseek() in conjunction with write() allows you to write to a file after a specified offset of bytes. 
-Each block has a backup superblock that acts as a recovery block and can be used to represent a block without corrupting its data. 

Nikita's Lessons Learned:
-Using lseek(), write(), read(), and open().
-Addition of free blocks to the free[] array of the super block in the V6 file system
-Using memset() to set certain amount of Bytes to 0 in a specified file
-How files are interconeccted using directories and inodes inside of the V6 file system

Zubair's Lessons Learned:
- Structure of the V6 File System, including the superblock and free array
- Using various unix file system calls like lseek(), write(), read(), etc.
