Members:
Haniya Zafar
Nikita Istomin
Zubair Shaik

Contributions: 
Zubair: worked on the add_free_block() and get_free_block() functions.
Nikita: worked on add_free_block() and initfs() function.
Haniya: worked on add_free_block() function. 
Lessons Learned: 
-Using lseek() in conjunction with write() allows you to write to a file after a specified offset of bytes. 
-Each block has a backup superblock that acts as a recovery block and can be used to represent a block without corrupting its data.
